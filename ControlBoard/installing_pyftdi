How to install pyftdi on various operating systems.
It's trivial on Arch, but I've read it's harder on Windows and possibly requires mighty Zadig. So whoever tries to install on Windows, please document your attempt here.


Arch
----
    sudo pip install pyftdi
# Possibly requires some other libraries, like libusb that were installed during RTLDSR/installing_pyrtlsdr; I don't know.
You should be able to do:
    sudo python3 ControlBoard/port_wrapper.py
And have it print out diagnostics along the lines of, "Writing Hello World to device \n Response from device Hello World"
